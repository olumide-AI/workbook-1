# Understanding Methods in Java

## Overview
In Java, a method is a block of code that performs a specific task. 
Methods are fundamental to Java programming, allowing for code reusability 
and modularity. They can accept input parameters, perform operations, 
and return results.

## Behavioral Goal
 - Encapsulation: Group related code into a single unit.
 - Reusability: Write once, use multiple times.
 - Modularity: Break down complex problems into manageable pieces.

## Strategy
 - Define methods with clear names and purposes.
 - Pass parameters to methods to provide input.
 - Return values from methods to get results.
 - Call methods from other parts of the code as needed.

## Implementation Guide

#### General Syntax
modifier returnType methodName(parameters) {
// method body
}
 - modifier: Access level (e.g., public, private).
 - returnType: Data type of the value returned (void if nothing).
 - methodName: Name of the method.
 - parameters: Input values (if any).
