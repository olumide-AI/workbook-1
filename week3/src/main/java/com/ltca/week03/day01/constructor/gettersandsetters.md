# Understanding Getters and Setters in Java (Beginner-Friendly)

If you're new to Java, you’ve probably seen methods called `getSomething()` or `setSomething()`. These are known as **getters** and **setters**, and they’re an essential part of working with objects.

This guide will explain:
- What getters and setters are
- Why and when to use them
- How to write them
- Common mistakes to avoid

## 🔍 What are Getters and Setters?

### 🟢 Getter
A **getter** is a method that *returns* the value of a private field.

```java
public int getLength() {
    return length;
}
```

### 🟠 Setter
A **setter** is a method that *changes* the value of a private field.

```java
public void setLength(int newLength) {
    this.length = newLength;
}
```

## 🔐 Why use them?

Java encourages **encapsulation**, which means:
- You keep fields `private` (hidden from other classes).
- You control access to them using `getters` and `setters`.

This gives you **control and safety**. For example:
- You can add validation inside a setter.
- You can prevent a value from being read or changed directly.

## 🧠 Example: Rectangle with Getters and Setters

```java
public class Rectangle {
    private int length;
    private int width;

    public Rectangle(int length, int width) {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    // Getters
    public int getLength() {
        return length;
    }

    public int getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    // Setters
    public void setLength(int length) {
        this.length = length;
    }

    public void setWidth(int width) {
        this.width = width;
    }
}
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | What goes wrong |
|--------|------------------|
| Forgetting `this.` in setters | You assign the parameter to itself, not the field |
| Using a setter without a getter | You can't read the value later |
| Making fields public and also using setters | You defeat the purpose of encapsulation |
| Not validating input in setters | Bugs and security issues may happen |

---

## 🛠️ When are Getters and Setters Needed?

| Situation | Should you use getters/setters? |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| You want to hide internal data | ✅ Yes |
| You want to control how data is accessed/updated | ✅ Yes |
| You're working in a quick test or small project | 🤷 Maybe not (but good practice to include) |
| You're building public APIs or libraries | ✅ Absolutely |

## 🧪 Summary

- Keep your fields **private**
- Use **getters** to read values
- Use **setters** to update values
- Always be careful with naming and `this.` usage
- Think about **when** and **why** access should be controlled

```java
public class Student {
    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

> Think of fields as your **house valuables**, and getters/setters as the **locks** on your doors and windows — they help control access.
