## Questions i have 
- Are java fields same as Python class attributes

## More on...
Static vs Non static 
- Non static applies (can only be called) to individual class objects not to the class itself
- You can call static methods on classes 
- You can make Static Field (often private not to be manipulated by other programs) 
if that's something that is going to be shared by the whole class 
- A non static field can't be referenced from like a static context
but you can access static fields or methods from an individual object - it's discouraged
- Access Static through class for clarity
