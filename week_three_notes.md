# week three

## Things to review 
- getters and setters 
- Encapsulation 
- Constructors, constructors overloading 
- -boolean flag 
- loops (while, do while, for)
- Exception Handling(checked and unchecked); try with resources
- File writing and Buffered reading 
- -Collections

## Bonus
- constructors chaining 

## Random notes
- Setting needs just one parameter 
- encapsulation is just a best practice so we don't access object directly 
and we set them privately and assigned getters and setters 
- I you don't add a constructor java adds a constructor for you 
- constructor is an addition to a class 
- constructor is used to create an object, create an instance of the class 
- overloading is two methods with the sam name but different parameter list 

## Question 
- why do getters have return statement and setters not
- so we dont use getter and setter in the class file
- Does setters not just work for final 
- a constructor format
- The directory structure for file reading 

## Notes on Collections
- Situation when you need to hold multiple items, building elements
- interface (contracts for class) contracts for specific behavior, behaviour characteristics of class
-
